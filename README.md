# Assessment

The project was generated using the [Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/Assessment) version 8.0.3.

## Database

When you run the application the database will be automatically created (if necessary) and the latest migrations will be applied.

Running database migrations is easy. Ensure you add the following flags to your command (values assume you are executing from repository root)

--`project src/Infrastructure` (optional if in this folder)
--`startup-project` src/Web
--`output-dir Data/Migrations`
For example, to add a new migration from the root folder:

`dotnet ef migrations add "SampleMigration" --project src\Infrastructure --startup-project src\Web --output-dir Data\Migrations`

## Code Styles & Formatting

The template includes [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support to help maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The **.editorconfig** file defines the coding styles applicable to this solution.

## Code Scaffolding

The template includes support to scaffold new commands and queries.

Start in the `.\src\Application\` folder.

Create a new command:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase --name CreateTodoList --feature-name TodoLists --usecase-type command --return-type int
```

Create a new query:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase -n GetTodos -fn TodoLists -ut query -rt TodosVm
```

If you encounter the error *"No templates or subcommands found matching: 'ca-usecase'."*, install the template and try again:

```bash
dotnet new install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template::8.0.3
```

## Test

The solution contains unit, integration, functional, and acceptance tests.

To run the unit, integration, and functional tests (excluding acceptance tests):
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~AcceptanceTests"
```

To run the acceptance tests, first start the application:

```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet run
```

Then, in a new console, run the tests:
```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet test
```
